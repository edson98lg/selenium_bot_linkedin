  # Selenium Bot Linkedin
This code is not intended for webscrapping, but for supervised low-scale information extraction.  
It is important to mention that Linkedin is a very difficult site to implement a bot, because it changes the XPATHS when it detects abnormal patterns.
 
## What does it do?
This supervised bot has the ability to extract the name, job position, duration of the position, total duration in the target company, company that was left
*name: the full name registered in linkedin
*job position: the full name(s) of the position(s) he/she held/holds at [target company] that he/she has registered.
*duration of the position: duration in months that he/she worked in that position
*total duration in the target company: duration in months that he/she worked at that company, regardless of the number of positions he held.
*company that was left: the link of the company he/she left when he/she resigned from the [target company], in case he/she is a current employee, it will be the link of the [target company]

## How to start
**First you must install the requirements.**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Second you must provide your credentials in `config.json`.**  
Additionally, you should know that in the `"LINKEDIN_TARGET_COMPANY"` variable, you should enter the target company.
